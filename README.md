# 10DaysDev

Over the next 10 days, Iâ€™m brushing up on my HTML and CSS skills, with a little JavaScript sprinkled in. Each day, Iâ€™ll be building something new â€“ from UI components to small interactive projects â€“ to strengthen my front-end fundamentals. Itâ€™s all about revising, experimenting, and having fun while leveling up!
